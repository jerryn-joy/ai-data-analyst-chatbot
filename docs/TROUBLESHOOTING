# Troubleshooting (Local)

## I see “Couldn’t find the tab…”
- Tab names must be exactly `Products`, `Customers`, `Orders`
- Check capitalization and trailing spaces

## “Some column headers don’t match…”
- Make sure headers match exactly (including `($)`)

## Chat URL confusion
- Copy Chat URL from the **Chat Trigger** node
- Local pattern typically: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/<id>/chat` :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## “Waiting for you to submit the chat”
- In some n8n versions the visual state can be finicky; ensure the flow ends cleanly or add a tiny (no-op) node near the end. (See community threads if needed.)
